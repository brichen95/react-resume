### 1. Pre-reqs
To build this website, you will need to have the latest stable versions of Node and Yarn downloaded and installed on your machine. If you don't already have them, you can get Node [here,](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and Yarn [here.](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### 2. Install dependencies and run

Once you have your own copy of this repo forked and downloaded, open the folder in your favorite terminal and run `yarn install` to install dependencies. Following this, run `yarn dev` to run the project. In your terminal you should be given the url of the running instance (usually http://localhost:3000 unless you have something else running).
